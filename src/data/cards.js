And this is how it was back in 2012.<br /><br /> <b>ETG needed a separate admin account on the Intranet.</b> A profile with a separate page was created automatically, and at that time there was a poster of Chuck Norris hanging in the office...<br /><br /> Historical note: Chuck Norris, aka Walker, Texas Ranger, aka the coolest meme character ever. Or, as the poster claimed, “Chuck Norris <b>doesn’t write code</b>, he stares at the computer screen until the right program <b>appears.”</b><br /><br /> So ETG couldn’t resist and created Chuck’s profile on the Intranet and Slack, giving him the position of Texas Ranger. Or he chose it himself, because we didn’t have such a title before he joined ETG. Now every employee can call him by dialing 777 and hear the intro theme song from Walker, Texas Ranger show. Rumor has it that this ringtone is not recorded, but Chuck himself is singing it a cappella.<br /><br /> Since then, Chuck Norris has only gotten cooler, and his job description includes notifying employees of important events, sending birthday and vacation reminders.',

Thus, even the decision of “when to ventilate” became analytics-driven.<br /><br /> Online store:<br /><br /> During one of the winters, Evgeny Khitrik found a reliable supplier of high-quality winter windshield washer at an affordable price, after which each employee could go to a special page on the intranet and order this cleaning liquid directly to the workplace. Later the assortment and delivery area expanded: you could even get a roll of toilet paper directly to the toilet cubicle.<br /><br /> Valentine’s Day Hearts:<br /><br /> One day, art director Niaz came up with the idea of a game for Valentine’s Day. There was little time to prepare, the idea seemed naive, but all these excuses didn’t work because the layouts were too good. The entire functionality was realized in one night.

Fortunately, the deadline was looming, so this agreement posed no threat.<br /><br /> From the beginning, we wanted to reflect in the name that the platform has the most favorable rates, and then someone came up with the idea of a hawk looking for its prey, like us for favorable rates. That’s how the name RateHawk came about.',

        descr: 'Chocolate salami is a dessert made of dark chocolate, cookies, egg butter with port wine or rum. It is especially popular in Italy, Portugal, Russia and ETG. It dates back to the days when remote working had not yet been invented and the team celebrated records and achievements together. Or rather used them as an excuse to eat chocolate salami and drink chocolate milk.<br /><br /> Either way, the tradition has survived to this day, so the occasional Slack question “Will there be chocolate milk?” can be answered with confidence that ETG will continue to order chocolate milk to offices on important occasions and write a big check to chocolate salami vendors.',

        descr: 'Customized Profile:<br /><br /> One of ETG’s values is freedom, such as the freedom to specify just about anything you want in your Intranet profile, such as providing your car’s license plate number for parking or add your custom position in the companyself-designating your job title (Lord of the Frontend will confirm it is really so).<br /><br /> Office Climate Control:<br /><br /> ETG employees were once unhappy with the air quality in the office, and that’s when the Intranet became the place to see the temperature, humidity, and CO2 status of the office. Thus, even the decision of “when to ventilate” became analytics-driven.<br /><br /> Online store:<br /><br /> During one of the winters, Evgeny Khitrik found a reliable supplier of high-quality winter windshield washer at an affordable price, after which each employee could go to a special page on the intranet and order this cleaning liquid directly to the workplace. Later the assortment and delivery area expanded: you could even get a roll of toilet paper directly to the toilet cubicle.<br /><br /> Valentine’s Day Hearts:<br /><br /> One day, art director Niaz came up with the idea of a game for Valentine’s Day. There was little time to prepare, the idea seemed naive, but all these excuses didn’t work because the layouts were too good. The entire functionality was realized in one night. The next day the work in the office practically stopped because of figuring out who sent a heart to whom and who didn’t, so a tradition was born.',
